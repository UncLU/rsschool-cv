I live in Surgut. I have been working in IT since

** 2019 - to date **  Business analyst. I am part of the project group for the development of ED in the SAP system.

Purpose: opening new horizons. learning new and interesting. purposeful, if an interesting project, then I dive with my whole head. Why did I start learning JS - I always liked creative work, when a "drop dead picture" is obtained from a set of letters of symbols
